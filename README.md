This repository contains the source for my personal website.

The site functions as a lightweight hub for the projects I’m actively working on: motorsports research, documentary photography, software systems, and writing.

Notes and blog content live alongside project links to reflect work in progress, not just outcomes.

Designed and built under FishTankTech.
